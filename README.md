## Project title:

Creating a Coversational Chatbot using Deep Q-Network 

## Summary:

The project focuses on how to create a conversational chatbot trained by a Deep Q-Network. The project goal is to examine how to effectively generate Chatbot that is used for customer support purposes which captures the characteristics of natural spoken language in English. This is a unique research focus as this is a goal-orientated problem; where the bot receives reward when and only when the question posed by the agent is answered, or the next best alternative answer is provided. We will explore model choices and customizations that performs optimally in this context.
